# 20-Individual_self_assessment

In a nutshell, what has been done in this project was:
Predict the price of a house, by correlating multiple attributes and the last sale price of a set of actual house in a given database, by using supervised regression model, and advance data analytics techniques and tool, such as python, jupyter notebook, SQL databases, and tableau visualizations.

The Data Analytics bootcamp has reinforced statistics knowledge and has given me tools that I have been able to use on the day by day activities in my current role position; I have improved the way to approach data, hence reducing time spent trying to read/understand the data, by leverage on data cleansing and visualization tools I have learnt so far.

When it goes to the project, jumping from having projects suggested in each module to a blank canvas was the first challenge, as well as take the lap and start writing a code while connecting with the team, and in mi case catch up in many modules and concepts, still working on it.

The approach of the team was to work together in each stage of the process to support each other while reinforcing the concepts required to meet the project deliverables; after finishing the project, I can say that my strength is on the data cleaning part while making sense on the characteristics and statistics of the data -where I was more involved-, together with the visualization in tableau. However, in the machine learning models, I have to practice more to develop and improve better skills.
